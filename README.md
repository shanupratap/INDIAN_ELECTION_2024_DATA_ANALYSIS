* This dataset contains the complete results of the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, sourced directly from the Election Commission of India's official website through an 
  automated script. The data was scraped on 5th June 2024, one day after the results were officially published.
* The mean (72,496.77 votes) is significantly higher than the median (2,781.00 votes), highlighting the impatc of the skewed distribution. In election analytics, 
  this large discrepancy suggests that while most constituencies have low voter turnout, a few with very high turout raise the average. The medai provides a better 
  measure of the central tendency in the skewed distribution, indicating that 50% of the constituencies have total votes less than 2,781.
* The large difference between the vote shares of the top two parties and the rest indicates a bi-polar electoral competition. This often translates to a more 
  predictable and concentrated voting pattern, potentially influencing campaign strategies and coalition formation.
* EVMs are electronic devices used for casting votes from voters to select their preferred candidate and that refer to the number of votes received by each candidate 
  through electronic voting machines during an election

* Postal Votes also known as mail-in voting or absentee voting, allows eligible voters to cast their votes by mail instead of in person at a polling station. So this 
  refer to the number of votes received by each candidate through postal or mail-in ballots.
* The negative slope of the linear line in graph indicate a downward trend over time for one or both types of votes. This suggests that the number of votes decreases 
  as the serial number increases, which could be indicative of various factors such as voter turnout, changing demographics or shifts on voter preferences.
